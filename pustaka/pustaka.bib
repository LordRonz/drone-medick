abstract = {This paper presents a novel unmanned aerial vehicle platform based on a three rotor configuration, which can achieve the highest level of maneuverability in all 6 dimensions (i.e. 3D position and 3D attitude). The three propellers can be tilted independently to obtain full force and torque vectoring authority, such that this new aerial robotic platform can overcome the limitations of a classic quadrotor UAV that cannot change its attitude while hovering at a stationary position. A robust feedback linearization controller is developed to deal with this highly coupled and nonlinear dynamics of the proposed tri-rotor UAV, which linearizes the dynamics globally using geometric transformations to produce a linear model that matches the Jacobi linearization of the nonlinear dynamics at the operating point of interest. A distributed formation control tracking protocol is then proposed to control a swarm of tri-rotor UAVs. The 3D position and 3D attitude of each vehicle can be controlled independently to follow a desired time-varying formation. The effectiveness of the designed control strategy is illustrated in a realistic virtual reality simulation environment based on real hardware parameters from a physical construction.}

ABSTRACT = {Water quality monitoring and predicting the changes in water characteristics require the collection of water samples in a timely manner. Water sample collection based on in situ measurable water quality indicators can increase the efficiency and precision of data collection while reducing the cost of laboratory analyses. The objective of this research was to develop an adaptive water sampling device for an aerial robot and demonstrate the accuracy of its functions in laboratory and field conditions. The prototype device consisted of a sensor node with dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, temperature, turbidity, and depth sensors, a microcontroller, and a sampler with three cartridges. Activation of water capturing cartridges was based on in situ measurements from the sensor node. The activation mechanism of the prototype device was tested with standard solutions in the laboratory and with autonomous water sampling flights over the 11-ha section of a lake. A total of seven sampling locations were selected based on a grid system. Each cartridge collected 130 mL of water samples at a 3.5 m depth. Mean water quality parameters were measured as 8.47 mg/L of dissolved oxygen, pH of 5.34, 7 &micro;S/cm of electrical conductivity, temperature of 18 &deg;C, and 37 Formazin Nephelometric Unit (FNU) of turbidity. The dissolved oxygen was within allowable limits that were pre-set in the self-activation computer program while the pH, electrical conductivity, and temperature were outside of allowable limits that were specified by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Therefore, the activation mechanism of the device was triggered and water samples were collected from all the sampling locations successfully. The adaptive water sampling with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-assisted water sampling device was proved to be a successful method for water quality evaluation.},

ABSTRACT = {Water quality assessment programs for the management of water resources require the collection of water samples for physical, chemical, and biological analyses. Lack of personnel, accessibility of water bodies, and time constraints, especially after natural disasters and emergencies, are some of the challenges of water sampling. To overcome these challenges, a custom-made thief-style water sampling mechanism was developed and mounted on a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for autonomous water sampling. The payload capacity and endurance of the UAV were determined using an indoor test station. The UAV was equipped with floatation, and electronic components were coated to prevent water damage in the event of a forced landing or for sample collection. Water samples from a 1.1 ha pond were collected with the developed UAV-assisted water sampling system and traditional manual methods. Dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, temperature and chloride measurements were made on samples collected with both UAV-assisted and manual methods and compared. Percent differences between the two sampling methods for DO, EC, pH, and temperature were minimal except for chloride level. Percent differences between the two sampling methods for DO, EC, pH, and temperature measurements were 3.6%, 2.3%, 0.76%, and 0.03%, respectively. Measured chloride levels for the manual and UAV-assisted sampling methods were 3.97 and 5.46 mg/L. UAV-assisted water sampling may prove faster and safer than manual water sampling from large surface waters and from difficult to access water bodies.},

ABSTRACT = {An unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted water quality measurement system (UAMS) was developed for in situ surface water quality measurement. A custom-built hexacopter was equipped with an open-source electronic sensors platform to measure the temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH of water. Electronic components of the system were coated with a water-resistant film, and the hexacopter was assembled with flotation equipment. The measurements were made at thirteen sampling waypoints within a 1.1 ha agricultural pond. Measurements made by an open-source multiprobe meter (OSMM) attached to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were compared to the measurements made by a commercial multiprobe meter (CMM). Percent differences between the OSMM and CMM measurements for DO, EC, pH, and temperature were 2.1 %, 3.43 %, 3.76 %, and &lt;1.0 %, respectively. The collected water quality data was used to interpret the spatial distribution of measurements in the pond. The UAMS successfully made semiautonomous in situ water quality measurements from predetermined waypoints. Water quality maps showed homogeneous distribution of measured constituents across the pond. The concept presented in this paper can be applied to the monitoring of water quality in larger surface waterbodies.},

abstract = {Technology is playing its part in globalization and the drone technology is such a technology with a usage ever increasing in a vast range of disciplines such as agriculture, health and military. Drones can provide real-time data on farms that enable farmers to make informed decisions regarding farm inputs usage. Also, they can be used to aerially deliver medical supplies like blood, vaccines, drugs, and laboratory test samples during health emergencies to remote areas in developing countries. Military drones also help in security and surveillance on the enemiesâ€™ movements which then helps select for target killings. Though beneficial, drones can cause injuries and damages to people and properties if the user is not trained and if there is a component failure during flight. Drones could also be hijacked by an extremist and divert the payload for their self-interest. In this paper, the Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis of the current developments of agricultural, medical, and military drones are presented.}

abstract = {Delivery drones and â€˜air taxisâ€™ are currently among the most intensely discussed emerging technologies, likely to expand mobility into the â€˜third dimensionâ€™ of low-level airspace. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 111 interdisciplinary publications (2013 - 03/2019). The review systematizes the current socio-technical debate on civil drones for transportation purposes allowing for a (critical) interim assessment. To guide the review process four dimensions of analysis were defined. A total of 2581 relevant quotations were subdivided into anticipated barriers (426), potential problems (1037), proposed solutions (737) and expected benefits (381). We found that the debate is characterized by predominantly technical and regulatory problems and barriers which are considered to prevent or impede the use of drones for parcel and passengers transportation. At the same time, definite economic expectations are juxtaposed with quite complex and differentiated concerns regarding societal and environmental impacts. Scrutinizing the most prevalent transportation-related promises of traffic reduction, travel time saving and environmental relief we found that there is a strong need to provide scientific evidence for the promises linked to the use of drones for transportation. We conclude that the debate on drones for transportation needs further qualification, emphasizing societal benefits and public involvement more strongly.}

abstract = {Unmanned aircraft, or drones, are a rapidly emerging sector of the aviation industry. There has been limited substantive research, however, into the public perception and acceptance of drones. This article presents the results from two surveys of the Australian public designed to investigate (1) whether the public perceive drones to be riskier than existing manned aviation, (2) whether the terminology used to describe the technology influences public perception, and (3) what the broader concerns are that may influence public acceptance of the technology. We find that the Australian public currently hold a relatively neutral attitude toward drones. Respondents did not consider the technology to be overly unsafe, risky, beneficial, or threatening. Drones are largely viewed as being of comparable risk to that of existing manned aviation. Furthermore, terminology had a minimal effect on the perception of the risks or acceptability of the technology. The neutral response is likely due to a lack of knowledge about the technology, which was also identified as the most prevalent public concern as opposed to the risks associated with its use. Privacy, military use, and misuse (e.g., terrorism) were also significant public concerns. The results suggest that society is yet to form an opinion of drones. As public knowledge increases, the current position is likely to change. Industry communication and media coverage will likely influence the ultimate position adopted by the public, which can be difficult to change once established.},

  abstract = {This work studies the security of ten popular package managers. These package managers
  use different security mechanisms that provide varying levels of usability and resilience
  to attack. We find that, despite their existing security mechanisms, all of these
  package managers have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a man-in-the-middle
  or a malicious mirror. While all current package managers suffer from vulnerabilities,
  their security is also positively or negatively impacted by the distribution's security
  practices. Weaknesses in package managers are more easily exploited when distributions
  use third-party mirrors as official mirrors. We were successful in using false credentials
  to obtain an official mirror on all five of the distributions we attempted. We also
  found that some security mechanisms that control where a client obtains metadata and
  packages from may actually decrease security. We analyze current package managers
  to show that by exploiting vulnerabilities, an attacker with a mirror can compromise
  or crash hundreds to thousands of clients weekly. The problems we disclose are now
  being corrected by many different package manager maintainers.},
